# Reshaping Space and Society: Japanese Colonial Group Relocation and Its Effects on Elevation-Based Social Structures Among the Paiwan

## Introduction:

Space is never neutral. For centuries, most of the Taiwanese aboriginals have claimed relations with their homelands—both physically and spiritually. These lands assisted in aiding social order, authority, and ancestral connection. Anthropologist Lévi-Strauss first proposed the idea of the House Society concept, in which the idea of a house does not just refer to the architectural sense but also to a durable social and symbolic entity, which could signify a larger cultural phenomenon **(Lévi-Strauss 1982)**. This model can then be effectively applied to better understand Austronesian societies, particularly those in Taiwan, as the House Society framework has been widely reflected in the social structures and organizational patterns of Taiwanese Indigenous groups **(Chiang 2008)**. Specifically, in utilizing this method, the ways in which the contemporary era understands the details of prehistoric Taiwan become clearer: by taking advantage of the landscape, such as elevation, water bodies, and indigenous vegetation, one comes to realize the pivotal roles relational spaces play in shaping the culture, hierarchy, and ideology of these groups.

## Culture under spatial backgrounds:

Many have utilized the concept of house society in an attempt to understand certain communities and groups better. Ranging to pre-historic to contemporary studies, one such example is seen presented by Chesson in his studies on modeling the structures of the Early Bronze Age, in which the author exhibits the value of the house society model for “its heuristic value…[that] embodies the dynamic, material changes that archaeologists can track diachronically through architectural and artifactial remains” **(Chesson 2003: 94)**. As there are no to very few written records detailing the events of these communities, their spatial orientation at a specific given point in time becomes crucial in divulging their past and continuities.

Similarly, instead of being heavily based on written records, among the several communities of Taiwanese indigenous societies, the Paiwan specifically has demonstrated a strong use of elevation and surrounding spaces in the makeup of their social hierarchy and groupings. As a community with a distinctive hierarchical social structure, it is divided into four classes: chiefs, nobles, warriors, and commoners—even rankings were divided within the noble class, which was based heavily on the chief’s lineage **(Lee 2020)**. Therefore, social parity, intra-class unions, as well as marital alliances with neighboring villages, became common, even more so emphasized when they focused their kinship through their settlement arrangements **(Lin 2023)**.

Nonetheless, what seems interesting is that the idea of a community being exactly “Paiwan”, in actuality, is a very modern concept defined by colonial Japan—an ideology and sense of belonging that the people themselves do not necessarily align with **(Ye 2014)**. For this, his research aims to narrow down to only several individual villages (社) as case studies. The elevation, orientation, as well as spatial organization within the community will be the focus and central to this study.

## Historical backdrop:

Following the cession of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the island underwent dramatic transformations in governance. Under Qing rule, Taiwan had been a peripheral frontier with minimal state control, particularly in indigenous and highland areas. Marked “savage boundary,” the borders were “outfitted with electrified barbed wire, mines, and mounted guns to curtail Aboriginal incursions into government-controlled [areas]” **(Hirano et al. 2018: 207)**. In contrast, Japan’s highly centralized bureaucracy expanded surveillance systems and modern infrastructures, significantly increasing contact between the Han settlers and highland aboriginals, which not only heightened tension but also conflict.

As noted as early as 1909, the Japanese implemented one of the first collective relocation policies on the Taiwanese indigenous groups: the Five-Year Plan to Pacify the Northern Savages. This policy, or more of a military campaign, aimed to suppress the last remnants of the rebelling aboriginals **(Hirano et al. 2018)**. However, conflicts evidently did not subside, if not increase, leading to a larger project to mass relocate the highland aboriginals to lower-elevation and more government-surveyed lands. While such policies as the ones in 1909 were already present, it was not until 1930 that the Japanese government began to systematically record group relocations, specifically beginning around 1931 for the Paiwan, indicating its increased prominence after this period until the end of colonization in 1945 **(Ye 2023)**.

## The effects of the relocation process:

Due to such mass relocations, the Taiwanese indigenous people who have claimed ancestral connections with their lands for generations were forced to part ways with their familiar environment, along with their established social order, hierarchy, and community organization. Especially in the case of the Paiwan, having the element of land elevation as one of the indicators for their societal rank and status, they now face a new dilemma, as they were forced to relocate to regions near the plains **(Chiang 2009)**. Mainly, there are three types of relocation: one being the same group divided into several subgroups, the second being close communities being separated, and the last of enemy groups being relocated together **(Ye 2023)**. In the case of the Paiwan, due to the diverse range of communities spanning from location, population size, and cultural similarities or differences, most of these cases apply to them as well. Nonetheless, for the focus of this project, in which the research will mainly examine the relocation process—the route including elevation changes—as well as its effects on the community reorganizations, only the two cases below will be discussed:

1. Tjukuvulj’s (德文) move to Mudan (牡丹)
2. Qinaljan’s (大龜文：大武山) move to Aljungic (安朔, 達仁 Daren)

The above two cases define the larger-scale phenomenon of the Japanese colonial forced relocation policies on the Paiwan, in which both moves occurred during the interval between 1940 and 1941, a time when historical records begin to show massive population relocations for these two groups **(Government-General of Taiwan, ca. 1895–1945)**. The sites could be narrowed down to approximately 1:3000 meters due to existing record descriptions.

### I. What to note about the data:

However, when defining a location and scale of the community itself, it is crucial to keep note of the following potential existing confounding variables:

1. It is difficult to define the range of certain communities/villages as there are no set borders, especially when certain cultural practices and languages are intermixed.
2. It is also difficult to define the said range of these communities/villages as the exact population size and number of family units in each of these groups differ as well, making a set indicator for the threshold of being a “community” difficult.
3. The third reason that makes defining the aboriginal communities difficult is due to the language barriers present in translation: the exact location of living, as well as what comprises these groups, could be unintentionally marked differently or accidentally omitted/lost in translation due to difficulty in recording and having a standardized translation template.

Nonetheless, the maps below will attempt to analyze these situations as impartial as possible through quantitative data, shedding light on potential occurrences and simulations of the relocation process; as, just as prominent the effects of social reoriganizations after village relocations, the toll of the moves themselves take just as significant as a historical legacies as it changes the dynamics of these communities as well.

### II. Data analyses:

The village points, plotted mainly from Japanese-era government survey records and studies of these sites in other dissertations—either through satellite images or descriptions—aim to have a general range of about 1:3000, the closest approximation. In the map below, Tjukuvulj’s move to Mudan and Qinaljan’s move to Aljungic have been drawn, accompanied by a base map layer of a Japanese-era map of Taiwan, circa 1939, around the time of such relocation processes.

While the hillshade maps allow easier visualization of the elevation differences, the closely zoomed-in elevation contour maps enable precise visualization of the Paiwan’s surroundings in the makeup of their house society structures. As could be noted, it is evident that in both the cause of Tjukuvulj and Qinaljan, the living conditions were above 1000 meters; the move to new settlements with elevations of approximately 370 and 270, an obvious decrease in elevation, largely affected their social composition and structure, such as methods of obtaining food, which will be discussed later.

### III. Tobler Hours

Lastly, by obtaining the slope, in degrees converted from the DEM in meters, to calculate Tobler Hours, we get an estimate of the relocation situation. Though there is not an exact pathway the Paiwan took, nor the estimated time that they took to relocate, which in itself could cause numerous confounding variables based on weather, their traveling abilities within the mountainous ranges, as well as governmental policies, the shading, derived form slopes in degrees, let us know what parts of the route would general take longer to travel and vice versa.

![SlopeImg](GIS_Images/SlopeImg.PNG)
<small>Fig. 4.1 Slope in degrees; DEM source from TGOS
</small>

From the map, one realizes that most of the pathways are arguably physically challenging, contributing to the tough and demanding process of such forced relocation.

Tobler’s Hiking Function, a mathematical model that estimates the walking speed over terrain based on slope, takes into account the fact that humans do not walk at the same speed uphill and downhill, therefore giving a more accurate result of travel times since it accounts the geography and slope themselves in addition to simply distance. The formula is derived as thus:

![ToblerEquation](GIS_Images/ToblerEquation.PNG)

- V = walking speed in km/h (velocity)
- 6 = the maximum possible walking speed based on Tobler’s data (6 km/h)
- e-3.5 = exponential decay; walk slower on steeper hills
- Θ = slope angle in radians
- tan(Θ) = rise/run (slope as gradient)
- +0.05 signifies the function in that the fastest speed is on a gentle downhill at about -2.86°

This mathematical formula could then be applied to GIS based on the DEM and slope raster files **(White 2015)**. To obtain the results of this function, the following mathematical expression could be applied to the raster calculator:

**6 * 2.71828 ^ (-3.5 * abs(Tan(("Slope@1" * 3.14159) / 180) + 0.05))**


![ToblerImg](GIS_Images/ToblerImg.PNG)
<small>Fig. 5.1 Tobler Hours; DEM source from TGOS
</small>

Instead of the exact mathematical constants such as e and pi, since GIS does not support such expressions, the estimations will be used. In the map, it notes how on steeper terrain (refer to the slope chart of approximately zero to seventy-nine degrees), the walking speed tends to be much slower, around one or less than one kilometer per hour. Most of the pathways the Paiwan had to travel range from approximately zero to two-point-five kilometers per hour, demonstrating the difficulty in their possible relocation route and process.

## Impact of the Move

### I. The case of the move from Tjukuvulj to Mudan

According to historical narratives, on December 25th of 1934, a young woman from Tjukuvulj went missing; believing it was their enemies that had killed her, the people of Tjukuvulj beheaded two people belonging to the rival tribes **(Shih 1998)**. This conflict made the Japanese move Tjukuvulj to Mudan at a later date, approximately 65 kilometers away. Such a policy had a detrimental effect on the people of Tjukuvuli, who, like most of the Paiwan, not only have made generations of connections with their farming and hunting ground, but have also organized their social spaces according to the sloped-styled atmosphere. Due to this move, the villagers living in Tjukuvulj—now Mudan—were forced to adopt a more agrarian lifestyle **(Lin 2023)**. Similarly, to adjust and accommodate to their shift in lifestyle, the settlements were reorganized along the river basins, forced to cohabitate with their Japanese colonizers **(Lin 2023)**. In such a process, the social hierarchies within the community as well as property ownership to land and other assets, as a result, gradually waned and diminished.

### II. The case of the move from Qinaljan to Aljungic

Unlike Tjukuvulj, which was a specific case-study village move, the people of Qinaljan were more of a scattered collective, though they share cultural similarities as well as large overlaps and superimpositions in their lands, communities, and relocation pathways **(Ye 2017)**. Due to their relatively late reclamation when compared to the other communities, the move was arguably more haphazard, leading to many being separated in different regions in southern Taiwan in the current era, including Aljungic, Smacarn, and Shitou **(Ye 2017)**. Around 1938, Qinaljan became powerful under Rovaniyau and Tjuleng, who formed an alliance to combat common enemies; the Japanese soon broke up the eclectic group of communities and forced them to relocate to Aljungic **(Lee 2020)**.

The original Qinaljan communities had lived in remote mountainous areas with steep cliffs and waterfalls, relying therefore on shifting cultivation that had been passed down for generations. According to one of the reports from Lee’s studies, the communities relocated to the plains—as a method for forcibly assimilating and controlling the indigenous—were pressured by the Japanese colonial regime to adopt a wet-rice agriculture that could be utilized to enhance social restructuring and colonial development under surveillance **(Lee 2020)**. All of the newly built houses had to follow standardized procedures, which included police stations as well as schools and clinics; each household also received a set of farming tools ranging from hoes to shovels and sickles **(Wen 2014)**. These land redistributions, labor demands, as well as cultural suppression arguably all had detrimental effects on the local aboriginal communities, whether for the better or worse.

## Conclusion

The forced relocations of the Paiwan under Japanese-era Taiwan not only altered the physical surroundings of indigenous life but also largely reshaped the foundational structure of Paiwan society, especially under the idea of the House Society. From the cases of Tjukuvulj and Qinaljan, who were moved from high elevation areas to lower plains, these regroupings of social organizations were not mere movements across space; they signify disruptions to cultural continuity and established systems of social order. Such ideas of heavy usage of the territorial surroundings and vertical landscape as a marker for status and tradition, as well as the impact of the relocations on the communities, can be examined through spatial data on GIS, specifically the elevation, slope, and travel distance. This research ultimately highlights the inseparability of space and society. Understanding the impact of Japanese colonization and its effects on the Taiwanese aboriginals through spatial and anthropological lenses enables the reconstruction of historical experiences, but also reaffirms the significance of bridging technology and stories to give voices to the complexities of displacement, resilience, and cultural legacy.
